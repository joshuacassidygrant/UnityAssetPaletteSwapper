# UnityAssetPaletteSwapper
A simple editor tool that lets you batch swap palettes for folders full of sprites!

To get started, import the unity package or download the PaletteSwapper.cs script. Drop it into your Assets/Editor folder and you'll be able to access "PaletteSwapper" from your Tools menu.

I haven't tested this with complicated sprites, but it works great for batches of low-colour sprites.
